And we absolutely don't want to mingle with the big boys and big girls so as to sway them left and right about the line of right and wrong. So what are we? What do we even do? What is our reason of existence?

And now, engineering becomes this one-size-fit-all cap that everybody can wear: it's attached to every single profession around us: software engineering, bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, construction engineering, social engineering, cyber engineering... to name a few. So many that in order to find a meaning to this word, it can only be described as: "things we do as human." And everything we do can be described in 3 basic words: "design, build and destroy." The idea that separates us from any other organisms in the cosmos is soly relied on the fact that we can design and build the tools, which are utilized to design and build other tools. This notion of being able to build on top of what's already there gives us everything that defines...us: memory, history and technology.
Hence, it can be said that engineers are the people who have the ability to "design, build and destroy" things. 
To answer the last question about our reason of existence, however, is a bit tricky. Human is an incredibly autonomous and diverse species. People own their ideas, their aspirations, their believes and their political views. Due to this unique level of diversity, it is very easy for one man to see the difference in another.
